// Key Functionality:
//  Three/Four Main Components:
//      1) Time,Location.Description viewer with the buttons to Edit, Update(same thing?), and Cancel(this could mean cancel the potlukk or be sent back to home)
//      2) Dishes View -> a table displaying the dish-name and an edit-button
//          -dishes that contain allergens should be in red text --> something extra could be finding allergen logos to display next to the dish
//          -Edit button should route you to either to an edit dish page or a pop-up window
//              -Name and Description Input, Serving size input, Allergen selection, Save button, and delete button
//      3) Potlukk Attendees View -> a table showing fullname and whether they have said: Accepted, Declined, or Maybe to the invite (also pending if the user hasn't replied)
//  Additional Buttons: 
//      [Bring Dish]-> creates a new dish (same as edit button but no delete button, we could do a [Cancel} instead which directs back to potlukk details) Should be marked as being brought by host
//      [Request Dish] -> creates a dish that can be broughtBy someone -- check out api, this is a property that can be used   
//      [Invite] -> can send more invites, can reuse the invite table from other component for this

// State Management: use Redux for this, Saga used for middle ware updates
//                          use it to update the dishes, and attendee info as the state changes
